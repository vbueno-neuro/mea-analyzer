# MEA Neural Metrics Configuration
# This file categorizes parameters by their data type for proper handling of missing values

metrics:

  # COUNT METRICS: Missing values = 0
  # These represent counts/numbers of events
  count_metrics:
    - "Number of Active Electrodes"
    - "Number of Bursts"
    - "Number of Network Bursts"
  
  # RATE METRICS: Missing values = 0
  # These represent frequencies/rates of activity
  rate_metrics:
    - "Weighted Mean Firing Rate (Hz)"
    - "Burst Frequency - Avg (Hz)"
    - "Network Burst Frequency"
  
  # INTERVAL/DURATION METRICS: Missing values = NaN
  # These represent time measurements (only exist when events occur)
  interval_duration_metrics:
    - "Burst Duration - Avg (sec)"
    - "Network Burst Duration - Avg (sec)"
    - "Network IBI Coefficient of Variation"
  
  # DERIVED METRICS: Missing values = NaN
  # These are calculated metrics that may not exist without activity
  derived_metrics:
    - "Synchrony Index"

# Notes on missing values:
# - Count/Rate metrics: 0 means "no events detected" which is valid data
# - Interval/Duration metrics: NaN means "cannot calculate" (no events to measure)
# - Derived metrics: NaN means "insufficient data to calculate"
